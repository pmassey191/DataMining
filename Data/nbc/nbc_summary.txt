This folder contains data on 40 television shows; although the shows themselves aired across a variety of networks, this data collected by NBC for the purposes of market research.  The descriptions below have more details on each file, but to briefly describe each one:
- nbc_showdetails.csv has data on the shows themselves: ratings, audience engagement measures, genre, and show length.  
- nbc_demographics has details on the demographic profiles of each show's audience.  
- nbc_pilotsurvey has survey data from a select panel of viewers who were asked to view the "pilot" (first episode) of each show and answer some basic questions on their responses.  

There are two goals associated with this data set:
- can we predict overall audience engagement and/or ratings based on data from the pilot survey?  
- can we predict who, demographically, a show will appeal to based on the pilot survey?
